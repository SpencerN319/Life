# Life
Conway's game of life. A cellular automation created in 1970 by John Horton Conway.

Simple cellular automation that has 4 rules. 
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies. -underpopulation-
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies. -overpopulation-
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell. -reproduction-

In this version you can adjust the number of generated cells and watch as they change states. 
The cells will continue to change states until they reach a never ending loop or are all eliminated.
